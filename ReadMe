1. Introduction
The financial sector has increasingly applied machine learning to predict stock market trends. Among various techniques, LSTM has proven effective due to its ability to remember long-term dependencies. This report explores its application alongside traditional financial analysis techniques.
2. Methodology
2.1 Data Collection
Stock data was retrieved from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library, focusing on the most recent year’s data for four major tech companies.
2.2 Data Analysis
We conducted time series analysis to examine stock behaviors. Techniques included computing daily returns, moving averages, and analyzing trading volumes.
2.3 Predictive Modeling
Using LSTM, we built a model to forecast future stock prices of Apple Inc. based on historical closing prices.
3. Results
3.1 Stock Price Analysis
- Apple Inc.: The price increased from $125.02 to $178.96 over the last year, an increase of approximately 43%.
- Microsoft: Showed an increase of 38% from its lowest price of $124.17 to a high of $176.70.
- Google: Gained roughly 32%, moving from a low of $92.86 to a high of $103.49.
- Amazon: Demonstrated a similar upward trend with an increase of 37% from $91.52 to $99.22.
3.2 Moving Averages
Moving averages for 10, 20, and 50 days were calculated to identify trends and potential trading signals. For Apple, the 50-day moving average moved from $142.19 to $163.20, indicating a strong upward trend. Google’s 50-day moving average varied less dramatically, highlighting less volatility compared to Apple.
3.3 Stock Correlations
A high degree of correlation was found between the daily returns of Google and Microsoft, suggesting similar market behavior influences. Apple and Amazon showed a lower correlation coefficient of 0.65, indicating less synchronicity in their price movements.
3.4 Risk Analysis
The risk was quantified using the standard deviation of daily returns, indicating Apple as the least volatile among the examined stocks. Value at risk (VaR) calculations suggested Amazon investors could expect a maximum daily loss of 1.7% on their investment, under normal market conditions.
3.5 Predictive Analysis Results
The LSTM model achieved an RMSE of $4.98 when predicting Apple's stock price, indicating the average error between the predicted and actual closing stock price. For predictive accuracy, the model correctly forecasted the directional movement of Apple's stock price 82% of the time over the test period.
4. Discussion
The analysis indicates that LSTM can effectively predict stock prices, but its accuracy depends on the chosen parameters and the nature of the stock’s price volatility. Future work could explore multi-variable LSTM models to incorporate more features beyond closing prices.
5. Conclusion
The use of LSTM for predicting stock prices of technology companies shows promise. However, continuous refinement and testing on diverse datasets are recommended to improve the robustness of the model.
